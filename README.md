**Easily set up a full-featured Icinga2 monitoring stack (Web2, Director, IcingaDB, Redis, Grafana, distributed polling, and optional nginx SSL proxy) on any major Linux distribution ‚Äì fully automated and ready to use!**

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automatic OS detection:** Debian (11, 12, 13), Ubuntu (20.04, 22.04, 24.04), RHEL (8, 9), CentOS (7, 8), Rocky Linux (8, 9), AlmaLinux (8, 9)
- **Smart dependency & repository management** per distribution
- **Interactive setup:** FQDN, proxy, Web2, Director, nginx, distributed polling
- **Unattended mode stub:** Ready for full automation via environment variables/flags
- **Secure password generation** and storage (`icinga2_credentials.txt`)
- **One-command install** for Icinga2, Web2, Director, IcingaDB, Redis, Grafana
- **All components pre-configured** and integrated
- **Optional nginx SSL proxy** with self-signed certificate or Let's Encrypt
- **Distributed polling:** automatic token generation, one-liner for satellites/agents
- **Modular codebase:** function files for Icinga & Grafana setup, advanced features in `lib/`
- **Auto-setup scripts** for satellites and agents
- **All credentials and tokens stored securely**
- **Robust error handling:** aborts on error, shows offending command and line
- **Idempotent sourcing:** all `lib/` scripts are checked before sourcing
- **Web server detection:** only restarts the web server in use
- **Health check:** post-install health check and summary

## üö¶ Quick Start

1. **Clone or fork this repo, or use directly from GitHub.**
2. **Run as root on your server (replace `v1.7.1` with the latest release tag for updates):**

```sh
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sandro12366/icinga-install-script/v1.7.1/install_master.sh)
```

> **Tip:** The [Releases page](https://github.com/Sandro12366/icinga-install-script/releases) always has the latest version. Just update the tag in the command above to match the newest release. Using `main` instead of a tag is possible, but not recommended for production as it may be unstable or inconsistent with the `lib/` scripts.

---

## üåê Distributed Polling (Satellites/Agents)

Connect a satellite or agent node with a single command (replace `<MASTER_IP>` and `<JOIN_TOKEN>`):

```sh
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sandro12366/icinga-install-script/v1.7.1/install_satellite.sh) <MASTER_IP> <JOIN_TOKEN>
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sandro12366/icinga-install-script/v1.7.1/install_agent.sh) <MASTER_IP> <JOIN_TOKEN>
```

> **Note:** The new `install_satellite.sh` and `install_agent.sh` scripts now fully replace the old `setup_satellite.sh` and `setup_agent.sh`. You can safely remove the old scripts from your repository.

---

## üîí Security

- All passwords are randomly generated and stored in `icinga2_credentials.txt` (`chmod 600`)
- The script checks for existing installations and warns before overwriting
- Hardened package checks and improved quoting for safety
- Handles MySQL/MariaDB root password and `auth_socket` edge cases

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced & Robustness Features

- **set -u**: aborts on unset variables
- **Improved error trap**: shows offending command and line
- **Explicit repo codename detection** for Debian/Ubuntu
- **Idempotent sourcing** of all `lib/` scripts
- **Web server detection** for restart logic
- **Stub for unattended mode** (expandable for CI/CD)

# Icinga2 Automated Installation Suite

This project provides robust, modular, and production-ready scripts for installing and managing a full Icinga2 monitoring stack, including distributed master, satellite, and agent nodes. The suite supports multiple Linux distributions, interactive and unattended modes, and advanced features such as SSL, proxy, notifications, and health checks.

## Main Scripts

- `install_master.sh`: Installs and configures an Icinga2 master node with Web2, Director, IcingaDB, Redis, Grafana, and optional modules (Icinga DB Web, Notifications Web).
- `install_satellite.sh`: Installs and configures an Icinga2 satellite node for distributed polling.
- `install_agent.sh`: Installs and configures an Icinga2 agent node for endpoint monitoring.

## Features
- Modular, robust, and auto-updating via GitHub releases
- Supports Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS, Rocky, AlmaLinux
- Interactive and unattended install modes
- Secure credential generation and storage
- Distributed polling (satellite/agent join tokens)
- SSL/Let's Encrypt, proxy, and hardening options
- Notification integration (SMTP, Slack/Teams)
- Health check and post-install summary
- CI/CD with ShellCheck and release automation

## Usage

**Install master node (one-liner):**
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<your-user>/<repo>/main/install_master.sh)
```

**Install satellite node:**
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<your-user>/<repo>/main/install_satellite.sh) <MASTER_IP> <JOIN_TOKEN>
```

**Install agent node:**
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<your-user>/<repo>/main/install_agent.sh) <MASTER_IP> <JOIN_TOKEN>
```
