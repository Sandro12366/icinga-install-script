## üö¶ Quick Start

1. **Clone or fork this repo, or use directly from GitHub.**
2. **Run as root on your server (replace `v1.3.0` with the latest release tag for updates):**

```sh
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sandro12366/icinga-install-script/v1.3.0/install_icinga2.sh)
```

> **Tip:** The [Releases page](https://github.com/Sandro12366/icinga-install-script/releases) always has the latest version. Just update the tag in the command above to match the newest release. Using `main` instead of a tag is possible, but not recommended for production as it may be unstable or inconsistent with the `lib/` scripts.

---

## üåê Distributed Polling (Satellites/Agents)

Connect a satellite or agent with a single command (replace `<MASTER_IP>` and `<JOIN_TOKEN>`):

```sh
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sandro12366/icinga-install-script/main/setup_satellite.sh) <MASTER_IP> <JOIN_TOKEN>
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sandro12366/icinga-install-script/main/setup_agent.sh) <MASTER_IP> <JOIN_TOKEN>
```

---

## üîí Security

- All passwords are randomly generated and stored in `icinga2_credentials.txt` (`chmod 600`)
- The script checks for existing installations and warns before overwriting
- Hardened package checks and improved quoting for safety
- Handles MySQL/MariaDB root password and `auth_socket` edge cases

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced & Robustness Features

- **set -u**: aborts on unset variables
- **Improved error trap**: shows offending command and line
- **Explicit repo codename detection** for Debian/Ubuntu
- **Idempotent sourcing** of all `lib/` scripts
- **Web server detection** for restart logic
- **Stub for unattended mode** (expandable for CI/CD)
