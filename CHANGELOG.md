# Changelog


## v1.5.0 (2025-07-17)
- Version bump to v1.5.0 for latest documentation, migration, and cleanup.
- All distributed node setup is now handled by `install_satellite.sh` and `install_agent.sh` only.
- Old setup scripts can be safely removed.

## [Unreleased]
- Renamed main scripts to `install_master.sh`, `install_satellite.sh`, and `install_agent.sh` for clarity and consistency
- Added/updated logical descriptions to all scripts
- Updated README to reflect new script names and improved documentation

## v1.4.0 (2025-07-17)
### Major Change: Satellite/Agent Script Migration
- Migrated all logic from `setup_satellite.sh` and `setup_agent.sh` into `install_satellite.sh` and `install_agent.sh`.
- The new scripts are now the official and only supported way to set up distributed nodes.
- Updated README to reflect this change and recommend removal of the old setup scripts.
- Bumped version to v1.4.0.

## v1.3.0 (2025-07-17)
### Automation: Automatic Release Generation
- **Automatic GitHub Release:**
  - Added `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow to automatically create a GitHub Release whenever a new tag (e.g., `v1.3.0`) is pushed.
  - The release uses `CHANGELOG.md` as the release notes for full transparency and traceability.
- **How it works:**
  - Push a new tag (e.g., `git tag v1.3.0 && git push --tags`).
  - GitHub Actions will create a release with the tag and changelog content.
- **Documentation:**
  - Updated project documentation to reflect this new automation.
  - Maintainers no longer need to manually create releasesâ€”just push a tag!
- **CI and release automation now fully integrated for a modern, professional workflow.**

## v1.2.0 (2025-07-17)
### Major Change: Release/Tag-Based Versioning
- **All script downloads (main and lib) now use release/tag-based versioning.**
  - The main script sets a `SCRIPT_VERSION` variable (e.g., `v1.2.0`).
  - All `lib/` scripts are always downloaded from the same release/tag as the main script, ensuring version consistency and atomic updates.
  - Users are encouraged to use the one-liner with a specific tag, e.g.:
    ```sh
    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sandro12366/icinga-install-script/v1.2.0/install_icinga2.sh)
    ```
- **Instructions for maintainers:**
  - After any change, bump `SCRIPT_VERSION`, commit, push, and create a new GitHub release/tag.
  - All users will then get the correct, matching versions of all scripts.
- **README and documentation updated** to reflect this new versioning approach.
- **Future-proofing:**
  - Consider automating release creation and version bumping with GitHub Actions (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for linting example).
  - Optionally, add SHA256 checksum verification for downloaded scripts for extra security.
  - Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `SUPPORT.md` for community and support best practices.
  - Added badges and CI workflow for professional polish and code quality.
  - See changelog and README for more advanced improvement suggestions.

## v1.1.1 (2025-07-17)
### Bug Fixes & Improvements
- **One-liner install robustness:**
  - The main script now automatically downloads all required `lib/` scripts from the GitHub repository if they are missing, ensuring the one-liner install works without a full repo clone.
- **Permissions:**
  - Downloaded `lib/` scripts are set as executable (`chmod +x`).
- **Error handling:**
  - If a `lib/` script cannot be downloaded, the script aborts with a clear error message.
- **Documentation:**
  - README updated to list all supported OS versions explicitly.
- **General:**
  - Minor quoting and logic improvements for robustness and maintainability.

## v1.1.0 (2025-07-17)
### Major Improvements
- **Robustness:**
  - Added `set -u` for unset variable detection.
  - Improved error trap to show the offending command and line number.
- **OS/Repo Handling:**
  - Explicitly set `VERSION_CODENAME` for Debian/Ubuntu repo URLs.
- **Package Checks:**
  - Hardened `is_installed` for dpkg-based systems (uses `dpkg-query`).
- **Database Setup:**
  - Added logic to handle MySQL root password and `auth_socket` edge cases.
  - SQL user creation now uses `IF NOT EXISTS` for idempotency.
- **Proxy Logic:**
  - Fixed proxy logic to match actual values of `PROXY_SETUP`.
- **Web Server Handling:**
  - Web root locations are now configurable.
  - Web server restarts only the one in use (nginx or apache).
- **Modularization:**
  - Sourced scripts in `lib/` are now checked for existence before sourcing (idempotent sourcing).
- **Unattended Mode:**
  - Added a stub for unattended mode (env/flags parsing, to be expanded).
- **Quoting:**
  - Improved variable quoting throughout for safety.
- **Health Check:**
  - Health check logic is now ready for further expansion in `lib/healthcheck.sh`.
